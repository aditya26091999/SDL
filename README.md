World Happiness Report (Machine Learning)

Here we have taken the Dataset from Kaggle.com

1.) The motive of this project is to plot figures and understand the relation between the predictor varaibles.
Also between the predictor and the ultimate response variable 'Happiness Score'.

2.) The next part deals with creating a simple ML program to predict the HS of your hypothetical country.
This will help you in analysing the necessary tweeks to the predictors to raise your rank.

3.) The idea will be to club the above functionalities using easy GUI created by PyQT5, and a choice to save the results in either file or database.
